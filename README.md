## Installing:
First you need to ```npm install``` to install all the necessary node dependecies. It's also necessary a Shazam Core API key (for general functionality) and a Ipify geolocation API key (for the Around You page). For this application, the free API plan was used in both cases. Any extra detail can be found in the .env.sample file above.

## Personal notes on this project:
  I've been focusing on guided projects in the last few weeks and think this one was one of the best ones yet. Being able to not only know how to make things around React but also understanding the best pratices and why things are made the way they are is a really enriching experience. Making these projects has really helped me improve both my technical knowledge and logical thinking, which makes me more confident to do good work on my projects.
  
  I feel pretty familiar with React by now and i want to try some different technologies in my next projects, like Next and some relational database. I've also been studying Java for quite a few days know and i'm excited to start making some projects in Spring.
